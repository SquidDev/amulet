\section{Standard Library}

\begin{itemize}
\item Numbers (Num, Integral, Fractional)
\item Debugging (Show/Debug, Read?, debug)
\item Iterables (Traversable, Foldable)
\item Binary, Text
\item IO, Async
\item Errors (Maybe, Either)
\item Monads (State, Reader, Writer)
\item General functions (id, undefined, error)
\item Avoid duplication at all costs (`m (m a) -> m a` is better than `[[a]] -> [a]`)
\item Monad Transformers or Freer?
\item If Lazy: `force : Lazy a -> a`
\item Number hierarchy: demhydraz recommends \url{https://tonyday567.github.io/tower/index.html}
\item Operators and their precedence
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Strings}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
class Binary a where
  toString : a -> String Byte
  fromStringHead : String Byte -> (a, String Byte)
  fromStringTail : String Byte -> (String Byte, a)
  -- not entirely sure about these deconstructing functions

instance Binary Byte where
  MAGIC

data String a = Binary a => MAGIC
\end{minted}

So then \texttt{Binary} would be \texttt{String Byte} and \texttt{Text} (or \texttt{BinaryString} and \texttt{UnicodeString}) would be \texttt{String CodePoint} (or maybe \texttt{String UTF8})

\begin{quote}
This would require codepoints to be a fixed size right? I haven't fully decided how to handle strings yet: the problem with UTF8 is that indexing them isn't $O(1)$.

No, \texttt{toString} can generate any length string and \texttt{fromStringHead} just needs to parse the first code point

There is a slight problem with \texttt{fromStringTail}: I don't know if you can parse UTF8 in reverse
