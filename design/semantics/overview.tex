\section{Summary of Amulet}

\begin{itemize}
\item A purely functional language
\item Uses the Extensible Effects monad\cite{kiselyov2013extensible} to represent side effects
\item Complex type system supporting type classes and row types
\item Strict by default, though laziness is encompassed in the type system
\end{itemize}
